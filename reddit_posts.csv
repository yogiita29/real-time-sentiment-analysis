"Google has stopped improving camera since Pixel 6 series, especially video",548,1n2awn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1n2awn8/google_has_stopped_improving_camera_since_pixel_6/,242,1756384147.0,"Photo quality is one of the top reasons I am a Pixel user. But it seems like Google has been resting too hard on their laurels with computational photography and give us a minor insignificant upgrade every year since Pixel 6 series. And when it comes to video there's been no improvement at all. 

Despite charging flagship money, the video quality is 5 generations behind iPhones. The Pixel 10 Pro and XL still doesn't do OIS right. The colors still change when you switch lenses mid video, and the transition is not smooth either as you zoom in and out - like you see in iPhones. 5 generations of Tensor and Google still hasn't figured video basics out. At least don't charge elite money for these phones. Gemini and Gen AI aren't a substitute to poor performance of basic features."

If I make the switch, I will wait for the 10 to be released.
To former Apple users who now use Pixel: What made you switch, and why did you stay? What are your likes and dislikes?
I once switched to Samsung but went back to Apple because I was so overwhelmed, so no Samsung for me."

TIFU by accidentally buying two Google Pixels and ended up getting my 15 year old Google Account permanently banned.,18512,zndbku,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/zndbku/tifu_by_accidentally_buying_two_google_pixels_and/,1329,1671193002.0,"So early Black Friday sales happened last month and I picked up a Google Pixel 7 since my previous phone was nearing 6 years old and starting to die every few hours.

Due to some funky error, whether I accidentally put two phones in the cart, I don't know or remember. I ended up getting double charged and realized I got shipped two phones.

I contacted Google Support to start a return for a refund on one of them, and the first support person was great... up until the next dozen support staff throughout this stupid journey.

Turns out that the package I shipped back to them never made it back. I spoke with support and I got the most generic responses ever from a person that doesn't speak English (once they stopped making generic replies, it was quite evident). 

They escalated the problem to a supervisor. The supervisor told me that they would do an investigation, would take about a week.

Beginning of this week, investigation ended. They say the package was indeed most likely lost but the representative I spoke to said I could just chargeback with my credit card. So I did.

Today, my Google account was banned. 15 years of history gone.

I went on the support chat for the umpteenth time and they told me because I did a chargeback, the rules are that my account will be banned. I asked why they suggest for me to do a chargeback, when they could have just refunded themselves, and they said the support I spoke to should never have suggested it but rules are rules. 

Been trying to fight this but looks like Google support is utter trash. After looking online, it seems like this is their most stupidest policy, and it exists across most other platforms too.

What a shitshow.

TLDR: Bought two phones by accident, returned one of them, package was lost and a representative told me to do a chargeback if I wanted my money back. Did that, Google account got banned. I asked very politely to get it unbanned because it was their advice to do that, they told me to go pound sand."

My Google Pixel Might Have Saved My Life Last Night - Seriously! (Drunk Driver Involved),1902,1joh6cx,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1joh6cx/my_google_pixel_might_have_saved_my_life_last/,169,1743462919.0,"Hey everyone, I just had a terrifying experience last night and I honestly believe my Google Pixel's crash detection feature might have saved my life. I feel like I need to share this urgently.


It was around 4 am and I was driving home from north Denver near 470 . The roads were very dark and a little damp from earlier rain. I was just cruising, tired but focused on getting home.


Then, it happened. One minute I was driving, the next, I saw headlights reflecting off something dark directly in my lane. It was a grey sedan just sitting there, completely unlit in the middle of the highway. I had maybe a split second to register what was happening before impact. My brakes were useless at that point. Everything went black the instant before I hit it. I honestly barely remember the impact itself.


The next thing I knew, I was coming to, disoriented and in pain. My airbags had deployed, and my phone had flown somewhere in the chaos. I was still trying to figure out what had just happened when I heard a voice. It was my Google Pixel Assistant, saying something like, ""It looks like you've been in an accident. I'm going to call emergency services if you don't respond."" I was still incredibly groggy, but I must have mumbled something or stayed silent, because the phone took action.


Within what felt like minutes (though it could have been longer), I heard sirens getting closer. When the paramedics and police arrived, they told me that 911 had received an automated call from my phone reporting a crash at my exact location. They knew there was an accident and where to find me, even though I was in no state to call for help myself.


What's even more disturbing is what the police told me later. The driver of the car I hit was heavily intoxicated and had apparently just been involved in another collision further back on the highway before inexplicably stopping in the middle of the road. He was a danger to everyone out there.


Honestly, thinking about what could have happened if my phone hadn't done that sends chills down my spine. I was unconscious or barely conscious, alone on a dark highway in the wee hours, after being hit by a drunk driver. Who knows how long I would have been there, injured and vulnerable, if it weren't for that feature.
I'm still processing everything and dealing with some minor scrapes and bruises. But I am so incredibly grateful for the technology in my pocket.


So, if you have a Google Pixel, please, please make sure your crash detection is enabled! It's not just a gimmick; it might literally be the thing that gets you the help you need when you can't ask for it yourself.


Stay vigilant and safe out there, everyone. You never know what you might encounter on the road.

 My review is in the works now that I'm back at the studio, but here are some Pixel 6 sample photosOverall I could give it a 9/10 but I have a looooot to explain. Stay tuned!

[MrMobile](https://twitter.com/Captain2Phones/status/1452637877892960257):

My Pixel 6 Review will arrive a bit later than others. For the past decade, ""hitting the embargo"" has driven my content timing. But sometimes - especially on a month like this, with the standards I try to meet- I simply can't deliver a review to be proud of in that timeframe.

[Dieter Bohn (The Verge)](https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1452685355493302281):

Apologies for not having a Pixel 6 review out today ‚Äî the bike accident chaos meant I caused the team a lost few days. dcseifert is jamming away on the review now and has lots of very good thoughts on them ‚Äî stay tuned!"
